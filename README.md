# Chicken-Disease-Classification

**Project Description:**
The primary objective of this project is to determine the health status of chickens, distinguishing between healthy ones and those afflicted by Coccidiosis, a prevalent disease. This is achieved through the utilization of a VGG model applied to images of chicken feces. To initiate the prediction process, kindly upload the relevant fecal image, and subsequently, by clicking the "Predict" button on the website, the model will generate its assessment. For your convenience, utilize the "Upload" button to select the specific fecal image requiring prediction.
